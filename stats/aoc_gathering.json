The real farming speed also depends on the walking distance and villager speed and carrying capacity (wheelbarrow and handcart). They require wood and a mill. Also, farms can be upgraded with the Horse Collar, Heavy Plow and Crop Rotation, to increase a maximum amount of food.

This way they can be lured to the Town Center to nullify the walking time, pretty much like sheeps, except that you cannot actively control them.
